## Introduction
The feature selection algorithms MultiSURF (Urbanowicz et al., 2017), MultiSURF*
(Granizo-Mackenzie & Moore, 2013), ReliefF (Kononenko et al., 1994), TuRF (Moore
& White, 2007), SURF (Greene et al., 2009), SURF* (Greene et al., 2010) are imple-
mented as described in Urbanowicz et al. (2017) paper. These feature selection al-
gorithms differ in the number of nearest neighbours, algorithmsâ€™ computational ef-
ficiency, and scoring methodology for selecting near or far instances. Another ap-
proach of feature selection involves iteratively removing or adding features to con-
struct a feature subset, guided by an estimator. The HSFSI framework provides two
meta-transformers implemented using the scikit-learn library based on the impor-
tance weights of linear support vector classifier with L1 penalty and extra Trees Clas-
sifier with 50 estimators for selecting features
